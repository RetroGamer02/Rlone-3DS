Building Rlone: Unix
====================
Once dependencies and headers have been installed, Rlone can be built with
a simple "make". The following is a list of Makefile commands:
 * make run     = Compiles and runs the game.
 * make install = Compiles and runs the games installer.
 * make dist    = Compiles and packages the resulting build/, and source code.
 * make clean   = Cleans up all build artifacts, including build/ and dist/.

The following are the Makefile defines that can be used:
 * make DEBUG=DEBUG   = Builds in debug mode, which increases stdout logging.
 * make O=<0,1,2,3,z> = Sets the optimization level, default is 3.
 * make BUILDDIR=path = Sets the output directory.
 * make DISTDIR=path  = Sets the distribution directory.

Building Rlone: Windows
=======================
Building Rlone on Windows is not nearly as streamlined as on *nix operating
systems, so some manual copying and project file changes will be required.

Before building Rlone, ensure you have downloaded the development files for
SDL2, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer.

This source package ships with a "windows/" directory, which contains a VS2022
solution file and project file. Once open in Visual Studio, you must change
the external include directories, and library directories, to point to where
you have saved the SDL2 development files. After this, you should be able to
build Rlone in debug or release modes.

Before you can run Rlone, however, you must also copy the appropriate SDL2, 
SDL_image, and SDL_mixer DLLs to the output directory for the game to launch.
After this has been done, you should be good to go!
