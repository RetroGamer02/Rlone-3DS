Rlone: A Rogue Clone
====================
You are an adventurer, of some kind.
You found a dungeon to explore.
Find as much gold as you can.
Good luck.

Rlone is a simple, ASCII rogue clone. Made mostly just as a fun project to try
and get something complete that isn't just a game engine or framework.

Dependencies
============
Rlone requires libSDL2, libSDL2_image, and libSDL2_mixer in order to function 
properly. The corresponding development headers are also required for building.

If you are not building from source, these will be installed via the provided
"install.sh" script if you are on a supported OS.

Configuration
=============
Rlone can be configured and customized to a fair extent, using the files in
"res/cfg/". Unfortunately, key-binds are unable to be changed.

Gameplay Details
================
The game operates using scaling map, mob, and loot generation, where as you 
descend further through the dungeon, the larger, harder, and more plentiful
each floor becomes. You, as the adventurer, also have no base stats, as your
stats are fully determined by your weapons and armor. As a result, it's
imperative that you check what you're about to pickup, as you can accidentally
destroy your run by replacing a legendary sword with a common sword that only
rolls 0s and 1s.

The bottom row is your UI, with the rows above being a configurable amount of
lines reserved to text updates for attack and damage rolls, loot pickups, etc.

The bottom right is your equipped weapons, which indicates which attacks you
are able to do.

Controls are available in-game.
